Hey!
I am an undergrad at IIT Kanpur, studying Mathematics. In my free time, I watch movies.

I am broadly interested in Probability, Machine Learning, and Optimization. I also like writing search/scrape utilities. 
My handle is juggernautjha, or some variation thereof, on most social media platforms because I am reasonably narcissistic. 
I also blog! [Check this out!](https://juggernautjha.gitlab.io/c17e)

juggernautjha/juggernautjha is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
